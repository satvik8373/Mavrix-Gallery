# **App Name**: ResumeRender

## Core Features:

- Template Listing: Template Listing: Display a variety of resume templates using HTML and CSS, rendered directly in the browser without external images.
- Live Previews: Live Miniature Previews: Each template card features a scrollable, scaled-down live preview of the resume, rendered using real CSS styles to accurately represent the final layout.
- Dynamic Generation: Dynamic HTML Generation: Resume previews are dynamically generated, embedding scalable divs that simulate resume layouts, and adapt to the viewing frame without requiring scrolling. They must represent real content well.
- Code Scaling: Code Styling: Use zoom or a scaling property of similar type, instead of an iframe
- Static Content: Static content: Since it is an MVP, no backend should be used, and resume templates are defined using hardcoded HTML/CSS for the previews
